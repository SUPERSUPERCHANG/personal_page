abstract: This paper presents a flexible needle guidance system and its workflow that enables registration of computed tomography (CT) and electromagnetic (EM) tracking systems with a finite element (FE) simulator for needle-based percutaneous spinal injections. CT is used only pre- and postoperatively for surgical planning and confirmation, while EM tracking is combined intraoperatively with an FE-based needle controller to track the planned needle trajectory and avoid obstacles. Evaluation of the proposed system using a multi-layer soft tissue phantom shows an average targeting accuracy of 0.4 mm.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose a CT-registered, EM-tracked, FE-based flexible needle manipulation system achieving 0.4 mm targeting accuracy for spinal injections.
